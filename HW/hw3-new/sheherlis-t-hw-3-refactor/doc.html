    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>This site is a glossary site based on the Nookipedia API built off the Nookipedia wiki. This is developed off the
        countless trips I took to find what seasons and locations were required to catch a fish to fill my museuem in
        game. The site compiles fish and bugs (and villagers for fun) so that they're all in one place. It uses one of
        my favorite css elements (backface visibility) in order to create compact cards for the information to display
        on. I tried implementing it so you can't have duplicate favorites and it kinda works but only in one specific
        circumstance so that has become an oh well with this project. I filled the requirements by pulling the data from
        the Nookipedia API and displaying it in an easy to read fashion, enough interactivity, as well as user controls
        (accessing the different endpoints, filtering said endpoints, adding favorites, and clearing the
        favorites). I think this project is probably like a low A or high B.</p>
